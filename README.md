# UNMAINTAINED

# Ruby bindings for Google's PDFium project

This allows Ruby efficiently to extract information from PDF files.

It currently has only very rudimantary PDF editing capabilities.

[API Documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/pdfium/) is also available and the test directory has examples of usage.

## Installing

The gem requires both the PDFium and freeimage libraries.

An [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~nathan-stitt/+archive/ubuntu/pdfium) is available for PDFium.

Freeimage should be installable via system packages.

## In memory render and extraction

```ruby
# Assuming AWS::S3 is already authorized elsewhere
bucket = AWS::S3.new.buckets['my-pdfs']

pdf = PDFium::Document.from_memory bucket.objects['secrets.pdf'].read
pdf.pages.each do | page |

  # render the complete page as a PNG with the height locked to 1000 pixels
  # The width will be calculated to maintain the proper aspect ratio
  path = "secrets/page-#{page.number}.png"
  bucket.objects[path].write page.as_image(height: 1000).data(:png)

  # extract and save each embedded image as a PNG
  page.images.each do | image |
    path = "secrets/page-#{page.number}-image-#{image.index}.png"
    bucket.objects[path].write image.data(:png)
  end

  # Extract text from page.  Will be encoded as UTF-16LE by default
  path = "secrets/page-#{page.number}-text.txt"
  bucket.objects[path].write page.text

end
```

## Open and saveing

```ruby
pdf = PDFium::Document.new("test.pdf")
pdf.save
```

## Document information

Page count:
```ruby
pdf.page_count
```

PDF Metadata:
```ruby
pdf.metadata
```

Returns a hash with keys = :title, :author :subject, :keywords, :creator, :producer, :creation_date, :mod_date


## Bookmarks

```ruby
def print_bookmarks(list, indent=0)
    list.bookmarks.each do | bm |
        print ' ' * indent
        puts bm.title
        print_marks( bm.children )
    end
end
print_bookmarks( pdf.bookmarks )
```

## Render page as an image

```ruby
pdf.each_page | page |
    page.as_image(width: 800).save("test-{page.number}.png")
end
```

## Extract embedded images from page
```ruby
doc = PDFium::Document.new("test.pdf")
page = doc.page_at(0)
page.images do |image|
    img.save("page-0-image-#{image.index}.png")
end
```

## Text access

Text is returned as a UTF-16LE encoded string.  Future version may return position information as well

```ruby
pdf.page_at(0).text.encode!("ASCII-8BIT")
```
